    <h1>Forest Fire Prevention</h1>
    
    <div>
        <p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Almost 40% of Bulgaria's territory is covered by forests.</li>
            <li>A mature beech tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people each year.</li>
            <li>A grassy area of 35 sq. m. can produce enough oxygen for one person's daily needs for a week.</li>
            <li>Over 90% of forest fires are caused by or related to human activity.</li>
            <li>Human negligence is the most common cause of forest fires.</li>
            <li>The average speed of wildfire spread is 22.5 km/h.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 >How to Protect Forests from Fire</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Do not light fires in the forest and do not use fireworks or other pyrotechnic products.</li>
        <li>Keep lighters and matches away from children.</li>
        <li><strong>Never throw away unextinguished cigarettes or matches!</strong></li>
        <li>Clearing of waste, including dry branches and grasses in forest areas, should be done by collecting, mowing, and transporting to designated places. Destruction by burning is prohibited!</li>
        <li>If you notice a fire, immediately call 112 and be ready to provide details about your location. Even if the fire has already been reported, any additional information you provide can be useful, such as color and size of the smoke column, topographic landmarks, road or paths, including people and activities spotted in the area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>If You're Hiking in the Mountains</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Lighting a fire is unacceptable outside designated and secured places.</li>
        <li>Prepare a container with enough water/soil to extinguish the fire in advance.</li>
        <li>Remove all dry branches, flammable items, and waste near the fireplace. There should be no dry grass and leaves within a radius of at least 3 meters.</li>
        <li>Don't make the fire pit larger than 50 cm in diameter. Never use flammable liquids (gasoline, diesel, etc.) to light the fire. This is dangerous and you may get injured.</li>
        <li><strong>Do not light fires during dry and windy weather!</strong></li>
        <li>Never leave an unextinguished fire! Thoroughly douse with water and check for remaining embers in the ashes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety Recommendations</h2>
    
    <h3>Understanding Smoke Signals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you notice a rising column of smoke, you can determine what is burning and where the fire is located.</li>
        <li>White smoke usually indicates finer, fast-burning grass (rapidly spreading fires where the grass burns in a short time).</li>
        <li>Dark smoke indicates that dense bushes or trees are burning. Due to heat, burning particles and coals can transfer to distant locations from the burning site and form other fire outbreaks, even across rivers and roads.</li>
        <li>The more smoke, the bigger the fire. If you see the smoke increasing, leave the area in a safe direction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Escape Routes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The direction in which the smoke column tilts shows the direction in which the fire is moving, so head in a different direction from where the fire is spreading.</li>
        <li>Fire spreads fastest in the direction of the wind. Move in the opposite direction if possible.</li>
        <li>If it suddenly gets smoky around you, leave the area immediately! Put a wet cloth or other fabric material on your nose and mouth to protect your airways.</li>
        <li>Fire usually spreads faster uphill than downhill, so don't try to escape through the ridge unless you're close to it and can quickly pass to the other side.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Safe Areas</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the fire approaches dangerously, head if possible to a large open area with little vegetation (rocky areas, meadows) or along water bodies.</li>
        <li>Protect your clothes from igniting, especially if they are made of synthetic material. If they catch fire, lie on the ground, cover your face with your hands, and roll.</li>
        <li>If possible, move through already burned terrain. It's safer there as there's nothing left to burn. Beware of falling trees and stepping into pockets of hot ash (smoldering gray-white piles where a massive tree has burned). The heated ground after the fire passes can melt the soles of your shoes.</li>
    </ul>
