      <p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Almost 40% of Bulgaria's territory is covered by forests.</li>
        <li>A mature beech tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people each year.</li>
        <li>A grassy area of 35 sq. m. can produce enough oxygen for one person's daily needs for a week.</li>
        <li>Over 90% of forest fires are caused by or related to human activity.</li>
        <li>Human negligence is the most common cause of forest fires.</li>
        <li>The average speed of wildfire spread is 22.5 km/h.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Protect Forests from Fire</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not light fires in the forest and do not use fireworks or other pyrotechnic products.</li>
        <li>Keep lighters and matches away from children.</li>
        <li>Never throw away unextinguished cigarettes or matches!</li>
        <li>Clearing of waste in forest areas should be done by collecting and transporting to designated places. Burning is prohibited!</li>
        <li>If you notice a fire, call 112 immediately and provide accurate information about your location and observations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>If You're Hiking in the Mountains</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Only light fires in designated and secured places.</li>
        <li>Prepare water or soil in advance to extinguish the fire.</li>
        <li>Clear dry vegetation within at least 3 meters of the fireplace.</li>
        <li>Keep the fire pit small (under 50 cm in diameter). Avoid flammable liquids.</li>
        <li>Do not light fires in dry and windy conditions.</li>
        <li>Never leave a fire unattended. Douse it thoroughly and check for embers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety Recommendations</h2>

      <h3>Understanding Smoke Signals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Smoke color indicates fire type and location: white = grass, dark = dense vegetation.</li>
        <li>Burning debris can cause secondary fires at a distance.</li>
        <li>More smoke = larger fire. Move away quickly if smoke increases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Escape Routes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the opposite direction of smoke tilt – that’s where the fire is heading.</li>
        <li>Wind drives fire — move against it if safe.</li>
        <li>If surrounded by smoke, evacuate and protect airways with wet cloth.</li>
        <li>Avoid climbing uphill unless the ridge is nearby and passable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Safe Areas</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Head to open, vegetation-free areas or near water bodies.</li>
        <li>Protect clothing from igniting. If on fire — drop, cover face, and roll.</li>
        <li>Move through already burned zones if necessary, but watch for falling trees and hot ash.</li>
      </ul>
